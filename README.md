## Project Overview
[In this project, the goal is to develop a machine learning classifier that can automatically classify tweets as either "Business" or "Not Business." The dataset provided is in the form of a CSV file and contains tweets that have been manually classified by human editors.

The objective is to create a classifier that can effectively replace the human editors by accurately predicting the category of each tweet. By automating the classification process, this project aims to streamline the analysis of Twitter data and enable faster and more efficient identification of tweets related to business activities.]
